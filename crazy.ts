// I need a function that gets the weather from the openweathermap API and translates the description into pig-latin.

// You need to write a function that takes in the location in the form of a zip code, fetches the weather data, then passes the description to the funtranslate API, and final returns the pig-latin version of the description. Alternately you can write a function that does the translation.

// Here are the api end points:

// https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip={zip}&appid={apiKey}&units={units}
// https://api.funtranslations.com/translate/pig-latin?text={desc}
